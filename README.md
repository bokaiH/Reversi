# Reversi Game with Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This repository contains an implementation of the classic board game, Reversi (also called Othello), which is empowered by the Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning. These algorithms are traditionally used in game tree search algorithms and the results of this project demonstrate their feasibility in improving AI performance in a strategic and complex board game like Reversi.

## About the Game

Reversi is a two-player board game where the objective is to end up with the majority of discs turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. 

## About Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm for decision-making and game theory. It is used for minimizing the worst-case scenario and maximizing the best case scenario, hence the name. 

Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. It eliminates the nodes in the game tree which are not influencing the final decision, hence reducing the computation time by a significant amount.
